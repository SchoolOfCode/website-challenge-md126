# Website Challenge

## Overview

For your first project on the bootcamp, we want you to make a website all about your pair partner using HTML and CSS.

The person you are making your website for is your partner, aka The Client. It is your job as a programmer to understand what the client wants from a profile site, assess what information is available and useful, design what serves the audience of users (aka the other bootcampers) best from the experience, and then create something which best solves those needs. You won't be given any guidance of what to build - you'll need to empathise with your users to see what they would find useful (or even survey and talk to them), and plan your site accordingly.

## Outcome

- a single web page created with HTML and CSS
- a profile describing your client
- a short 1-page README.md file alongside it which describes how you went about the project (your thoughts, research, plans, and justification for decisions)

## Extra

This is not only a chance for you to practice the core skills of HTML and CSS, but also a chance to invest time in thinking about how to build a website for a client, and have a user-centric approach - a key learning objective of the course. You will need to actively communicate with the client to find out everything you need in order to design and build a website which represents them to the rest of the cohort.

Although you will each have an individual repository in which to make the website, there is nothing stopping you pair programming with your partner on the project. Organise your time so that you can spend an equal amount of time on each project. For example, if you spend three hours coding together on Sunday, you would spend 1.5 hours pair programming on one site, before moving over to the other site.

This project will span the first two weeks of the bootcamp, and you will be given time in live evening sessions to work on it as well.

## _Nicely_

A clear and concise summary of what I have learnt would be that HTML and CSS are the foundations of the web. HTML— HyperText Markup Language— is the standard markup language used to write web pages which is then shared across the web. HTML is made up of elements- paragraphs, headers, lists, links-, attributes and comments which give each web page structure and contain the content of the page itself- text, images, videos. A website is simply a collection of webpages located on a same domain. Programs used to open HTML documents, is a browser, as it interprets the source code. CSS— Cascading Style Sheets— is the language we use to style an HTML document and describes how HTML elements should be displayed. Using CSS, you can give a web page its own backgrounds, font, text styles, colors. Simply put, CSS is what makes HTML look good.
